* elinter
This is a complete rewrite of my Emacs Lisp package checker, formerly called =emacs-package-checker= or =melpa-check=. It is currently in alpha, and most of its basic features are not implemented yet.
** Installation
Clone this repository and run

#+begin_src sh
  nix-env -iA main
#+end_src
** Usage
The =main= Nix derivation provides =elinter= executable.

It takes MELPA-style recipe files as arguments and runs linting tasks and =byte-compile= on local source files by default.

You can omit the recipe files by putting them in =.recipes= directory in the working directory.
Recipes can be generated using [[https://github.com/akirak/decask.el][decask.el]] from a local copy of the MELPA repository.
