* elinter
This is a complete rewrite of my Emacs Lisp package checker, formerly called =emacs-package-checker= or =melpa-check=. It is still currently at an alpha stage.

** Design goals
This project is designed with the following goals in mind:

- Support both local use and CI
- Comprehensive linting using various backends (should be at least as capable as [[https://github.com/riscy/melpazoid/][melpazoid]], which is created and used by the official reviewer on [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]])
- Use [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] to support dependencies that involve specific build procedures and/or native dependencies, e.g. =emacsql-sqlite=
- Support projects containing multiple packages in the same repository
- Allow ease of setup for new projects and ease of migration for existing projects, e.g. from Cask
- Minimal configuration and minimal maintenance
- Can be integrated into the PR workflow of MELPA
** Planned features [69%]
The following is a list of features that should be supported by this project.
Maybe I'll announce this project officially when the progress reaches around 80%.

** Prerequisites
=elinter= runs on UNIX-like operating systems that can run [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] (currently Linux and macOS).
** Installation
=elinter= depends on Nix, so you have to install Nix first:

#+begin_src sh
bash <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
#+end_src

=elinter= can be installed using Nix:

#+begin_src sh
nix-env -if https://github.com/akirak/elinter/archive/v4.tar.gz
#+end_src

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and run

#+begin_src sh
nix-env -if .
#+end_src

Optionally, it is recommended to install [[https://github.com/cachix/cachix][cachix]] and enable cached Emacs binaries:

#+begin_src sh
cachix use emacs-ci
#+end_src

Optionally, you can use [[https://github.com/xzfc/cached-nix-shell][cached-nix-shell]] for improving =nix-shell= startup time.
Install the program in =PATH=, and =elinter= will automatically detect it.
** Usage
*** Use case #1: Local source + in-repository recipes
First create package recipes in =.recipes= directory.
The recipe format is [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa/#recipe-format][the same as you would create for MELPA]], and each file should define exactly one package.

You can use =elinter.el=, which is included in this project, to copy existing recipes from your local copy of MELPA.
First set =elinter-recipes-dir= to the =recipes= directory inside MELPA, and then use =elinter= interactive function.
It scans source files in the repository, import package recipes, and run lint on source files.

The below describes command line usage but also applies to =elinter= command inside Emacs.

Without arguments, it lints and compiles source files in the repository:

#+begin_src sh
elinter
#+end_src

To enable experimental checks by [[https://github.com/riscy/melpazoid/][melpazoid]] which you would receive on MELPA PRs, add =--experimental= flag:

#+begin_src sh
elinter --experimental
#+end_src

With =--buttercup= or =--ert-runner= flag, it also runs tests:

#+begin_src sh
elinter --buttercup
#+end_src

To only lint packages and prevent from byte-compiling, add =-l= flag:

#+begin_src sh
elinter -l
#+end_src

To only byte-compile source files, add =-b= flag:

#+begin_src sh
elinter -b
#+end_src

To only run tests, run it with =-t= along with the =--buttercup=, =--ert-runner=, etc.:

#+begin_src sh
elinter -t --buttercup
#+end_src

See [[https://github.com/akirak/elinter-demo/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml][elinter-demo]] and [[https://github.com/akirak/elinter-demo/actions?query=workflow%3ADemo][its status page]] for concrete examples.
*** Use case #2: Local recipes + remote sources
This is like the use case 1, but it clones the remote repository specified in the recipe rather than work on source files in the working directory.

=elinter= command accepts recipe files as arguments. When =-r= flag is given, it clones remote Git repositories according to the recipes.
This can be easily integrated into the MELPA PR workflow:

#+begin_src sh
cd ~/your-melpa-fork
elinter -r recipes/your-package --experimental
#+end_src

The same flags as #1 applies.
*** Use case #3: GitHub workflow for package repositories
This repository also provides a GitHub action for checking individual packages on GitHub.

The following is an example workflow. Create a file in =.github/workflows=. Here is [[https://github.com/akirak/elinter/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Action+CI%22][an example output]].

#+begin_src yaml
  name: CI
  on:
    push:
  jobs:
    ci:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Nix is required
      - uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v10
      # Install elinter and run lint and byte-compile
      - uses: akirak/elinter@v4
      # Optional step for running tests
      - name: 'Run buttercup tests with the latest release of Emacs'
        run: elinter -t --buttercup -e latest
#+end_src
*** Use case #4: GitHub workflow for batch-linting your packages on MELPA
Since =elinter= command can take recipe files as arguments and fetch remote repositories, it is possible to add a linting workflow to your copy of [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa][MELPA]].

Here is [[https://github.com/akirak/melpa/blob/internal/.github/workflows/akirak.yml][an example workflow definition]] and [[https://github.com/akirak/melpa/actions?query=workflow%3ACI][output]].
*** Use case #5: Git pre-commit hook
This repository also provides a script that can be integrated into Git =pre-commit= hook.

If you run =elinter= with =-g= argument at a repository root, it installs a =pre-commit= hook that
performs static checks based on the recipe(s).

It uses [[https://pre-commit.com/][pre-commit]], and =.pre-commit-config.yaml= is created at the repository root.

Note that byte-compilation is not performed by the hook.

Alternatively, you can use [[cachix/pre-commit-hooks.nix][cachix/pre-commit-hooks.nix]] to configure the hook for multiple languages in Nix. The following is an example:

#+begin_src nix
  with builtins;
  with (import <nixpkgs> {});
  with (import (import ./nix/sources.nix).gitignore { });
  let
    pre-commit-hooks = import (import ./nix/sources.nix)."pre-commit-hooks.nix";

    elinter = import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/akirak/elinter/archive/v4.tar.gz") { };

    pre-commit-check = pre-commit-hooks.run {
      src = gitignoreSource ../.;
      excludes = [ "^nix/sources\.nix$" ];
      hooks = {
        shellcheck.enable = true;
        nix-linter.enable = true;
        nixpkgs-fmt.enable = true;
        elinter = {
          enable = true;
          name = "elinter";
          description = "Lint Emacs Lisp files";
          entry = "${elinter.file-linter}/bin/elinter-lint-files";
          files = "\\.el$";
        };
      };
    };
  in
  mkShell {
    shellHook = pre-commit-check.shellHook;
  }
#+end_src

That is, =file-linter= Nix attribute of this repository provides =elinter-lint-files= executable
which performs static checks on given files, so you can integrate it using any Git hooks manager:

#+begin_src sh
# install the script
nix-env -if . -A file-linter
# check source files in your repository
elinter-lint-files hello.el hello-utils.el
#+end_src
** Technical details
*** elinter command
The default Nix derivation provides =elinter= executable.
It takes recipe files as command line arguments.

It can also take package names and it refers to source files linked from the sandbox (described below).

If no recipe file or package name is given as an argument, it looks for ones in =.recipes= directory in the working directory.
*** Emacs version syntax
=elinter= command supports =-e= option that takes an Emacs version, e.g. =26.3= for Emacs 26.3 and =snapshot= for the latest snapshot. You can use any single version available in nix-emacs-ci.

It also supports the following abstract version specs:

- =min=, the minimum version specified in the library header of each package
- =latest=, the latest stable version
- =all=, all versions since the minimum version including the snapshot, in descending order
*** Updating packages
To update dependencies, e.g. =emacs-overlay= for Emacs packages and =nix-emacs-ci= for Emacs itself, add =-u= flag to the =elinter= command:

#+begin_src sh
elinter -u RECIPES
#+end_src
*** Sandboxing
=elinter= creates symbolic links in a cache directory and operates on them, rather than lint and compile source files directly in the repository.
This is useful both for simplification and isolation.
Once symbolic links are created, they are reused across different runs for performance.
Since they are symbolic links, file modifications are reflected, but file additions/deletions are not applied.
After you create/delete a source file in the repository, you have to run =elinter= with =-c= arguments to recreate the sandbox:

#+begin_src sh
elinter -c
#+end_src

You can use =-c= with other arguments:

#+begin_src sh
elinter -c -l --experimental
#+end_src
